# Spatial Design Course - Digital Archiving Machine ðŸ“‚

This project explores the intersection of **digital archiving and interactive design**.  
Developed in Python and C++, the archiving machine enables **live image capture, real-time hardware interaction, and a structured digital gallery system.**

## ðŸ”§ Main Components

1. **Camera Manager**  
   - Implemented with **OpenCV**  
   - Captures snapshots from a live webcam stream  
   - Handles **image acquisition** and **preprocessing tasks**

2. **GUI Manager**  
   - Built with **Pygame**  
   - Provides a simple graphical interface  
   - Updates display elements and manages user interactions via button inputs  

3. **Arduino Manager**  
   - Facilitates serial communication between the computer and an **Arduino board**  
   - Sends and receives commands (e.g., activating LEDs)  
   - Enables **real-time hardware control** during interactions  

4. **Gallery Manager**  
   - Organizes and maintains the image library structure  
   - Logs scan sessions in a **JSON file**  
   - Preserves hierarchy and metadata for **future reference**
